This blog may seem visually appealing to you. If it does, then all credit goes to [WinterSmith][1]! If not,
all credit still goes to Wintersmith, but know that they have a variety of configurations and templates to
suit almost every taste!

As for the individual curating the blog, that would be me:  Christian Broomfield, a junior software developer
from Germany. I'm always looking for freelance work or a good discussion, so feel free to contact
me via [email][2] or [github][3].
